# Memmpy
Memmpy is a Python library for storing datasets in, and loading datasets from, [memory mapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file) files. This is particularly useful for large datasets that do not fit in memory and therefore need to be processed in batches. Memmpy is based on the [`numpy.memmap`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.memmap.html) implementation.

## Who should use Memmpy?
Memmpy is primarily intended for use in medium to large scale machine learning applications in high energy particle physics, where the whole dataset would not fit into memory at once and iterating over the ROOT files is too slow. This could be because shuffling of datapoints is desired, or because only a fraction of the information or events is needed for training. 

Memmpy is not intended for use in small applications where the entire dataset fits into memory and can be loaded at once. It is also not intended for use in very large applications where training is massively distributed.

## Installation
Memmpy can be installed directly from PyPI using `pip`. Memmpy requires Python 3.10 or higher.
If you want to process `.root` files, `uproot` is required. This can also be installed using `pip`.
```bash
pip install memmpy
```

## Usage
A simple memory mapped file can be created as follows:
```python
with WriteVector(path="data.mmpy", key="testdata") as memfile:
    # Append a single numpy array.
    # The shape and dtype will be inferred from the array.
    memfile.append(np.array([1, 2, 3]))
    
    # Append another numpy array of the same shape and dtype
    memfile.append(np.array([4, 5, 6]))

    # Extend the file by an array with an additional axis.
    memfile.extend(np.array([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]))

memmap_data = read_vector(path="data.mmpy", key="testdata")
```

The `mempy` library also provides functionality to store jagged arrays or arrays with arbitrary shape using the `WriteJagged`, `ReadJagged`, `WriteShaped` and `ReadShaped` classes.

### Loading
A collection of memory mapped files can be loaded in batches using the `SimpleLoader` and `SplitLoader`. The `SplitLoader` also provides functionality for shuffling the dataset and splitting it into training and validation sets.
```python
loader = SplitLoader(
    # provide a dict of memmap, ReadJagged or ReadShaped
    data={"first_memmap": memmap, ...},  
    batch_size=128,
    shuffle=True,
)
    
for batch in loader:
    ...
```

### Filtering
Datasets can be filtered using the `compute_cut_batched` function.
```python
subindicies = compute_cut_batched(
    path="data.mmpy",
    expression="testdata > 5"
)
```
The subindicies can be used to load only the filtered dataset, by passing them to the `SplitLoader`. All computed cuts are automtatically cached.

### Processing ROOT files
To use `memmpy` with ROOT files, the `uproot` module is required. It can be installed using `pip`. The `load_root` function provides all-in-one functionality to load (multiple) ROOT files into memory. An example is shown below.
```python
loader = load_root(
    root_files=[
        RFileConfig(
            path="ttbb_mc16a.root",
            tree="tree1",
            metadata={"process": "ttbb", "year": "mc16a"},
        ),
        RFileConfig(
            path="ttH_mc16d.root",
            tree="tree2",
            metadata={"process": "ttH", "year": "mc16d"},
        ),
    ],
    path_mmap="data.mmpy",
    keys={"nJets", "nBTags_77"},
    # variable length arrays can be padded to the same length with a given value
    keys_padded={"jet_pt": (22, float("nan"))}, 
    batch_size=128,
    tcut="nJets >= 6 & nBTags_77 >= 2",
)
```
All results are cached, so the next time the function is called, the dataset is loaded from the cache instead of the ROOT files. The metadata is stored in hashed form, so it is also possible to apply cuts to the metadata.
Changing any of the ROOT files on disk will invalidate the cache, so the dataset will automatically be reloaded from the ROOT files the next time the function is called.

### Metadata
The metadata is stored in a separate json file, located at `path/metadata_memmpy.json'. This includes the shapes and dtypes of the arrays, as well as checksums or timestamps that are calculated when the dataset is saved.
The supplied ROOT file metadata is also stored, along with its hashes, so that the metadata can be fully reconstructed from the stored memory mapped files.
